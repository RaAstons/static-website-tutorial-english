## Static and dynamic websites

The first day of the workshop just started and you will already be publishing things to the internet, isn't that exciting? But then why does the workshop take two whole days? To understand this we have to explain the difference between static and dynamic websites. During our website we will make both, and then you will be able to combine them. 

### Static website

A static webpage is a page that is lying on the Server as a whole. When displayed it always looks exactly the same as when it was created. It is not possible to interact with the users of your site. Using a static website you can have multiple pages and links in between them, which the user can click on. Those links can then bring your users to other pages you created. But all pages are shown exactly the way they are lying on the server. It is not possible to let a user fill in a form, and process this information, or show data from a database. All of this is only possible with dynamic sites. To make static website you only need to use two languages: HTML \(to define the structure of your web pages\) and CSS \(to define the layout\).

Typical examples of static web pages are:
 * Simple personal websites
 * Basic websites for small businesses

### Dynamic website

Dynamic websites are a bit more complicated than the static ones. They usually exist of so called templates, in which you can fill in dynamic data depending on the situation before you send them to the user. Templates use HTML and CSS just like static web pages, and therefor look very similar to them. However, unlike static web pages, they have placeholders, where you want to put in the dynamic data before you send them. To fill these holes, you will need another programming language. In our case this is python. In addition to that dynamic websites often use a database to store information such as blog posts, comments from users, likes etc. All of this together makes it possible for a dynamic website to let a user fill in a form, and generate a dynamic response to that.

Examples of dynamic websites:
 * Social media sites (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, ...)
 * Search engines (Google)
 * Online shops (Amazon)
 * Any website where you can create an account
 * Almost all of the internet ðŸ˜‰
