# Introduction to Python

Now that you have learned how to use the tools (Command Line, git, GitHub) that programmers use, and understand the basic building blocks of a website (HTML and CSS), it is time to learn your first programming language.

[Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language) is a widely used general-purpose programming language. That means that you can use it for all kinds of different tasks. Here is just a short list of things that Python is used for:

* automatic tasks such as copying and renaming files
* downloading and processing data from the internet
* manipulating images
* scientific research to analyze data and do complex computations
* controlling small robots and smart devices in your home
* creating dynamic website (like what you will be doing tomorrow)
* many, many more possibilities

Python is just one of many different programming languages. It was created and released by Guido van Rossum in 1991. There are many other programming languages that you might have heard of before (Java, C, Swift, COBOL, Ruby). Which programming language you choose for your projects depends on many different aspects: the platform you want to run it on, the speed it should have, how complicated the task is. However, often it also depends on the programmer. Which language do they already know? What is their preferred programming language?

We have chosen Python for our workshop because it runs on all common platforms (Window, Mac and Linux) and because it is easier to learn than a lot of the other programming languages. And of course because we (the organizers and coaches) like it.

But that's justification, we'll just show you how it works and hope you will have fun using it as well. Complete the ["Introduction to Python"](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/) chapter in the official Django Girls tutorial and find out how it works yourself. Of course your coach is always here to answer any of your questions. Don't hesitate to ask if you don't understand somethings. That's exactly what they are here for.
