## A. Preparation (before the workshop)
To be fully prepared for the workshop please follow the steps below to get your laptop and yourself ready for the learning experience.

### Installing the tools

You need to install a code editor and Git and create a GitHub account.

#### Install a code editor

There are a lot of different editors and it largely boils down to personal preference. We recommend to start with Atom, if you don't have a strong preference for another code editor.

Atom is an extremely new code editor created by GitHub. It's free, open-source, easy to install and easy to use. It's available for Windows, OS X and Linux.

[Download it here](https://atom.io/)

#### Install Git

Git is a "version control system" used by a lot of programmers. This software can track changes to files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. A bit like the "track changes" feature in Microsoft Word, but much more powerful.

##### Mac/OS X
Download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com) and just follow the instructions.

> **NOTE:** Note If you are running OS X 10.6, 10.7, or 10.8, you will need to install the version of git from here: Git installer for OS X Snow Leopard

> macOS High Sierra: It is not possible anymore to get rid of the system version of git (the so called git stub) using the proposed "sudo mv /usr/bin/git /usr/bin/git-system" from git-scm, neither does /usr/local/bin take precedence over /usr/bin. The easiest way to get your new git installation working, is to create a .bash_profile in your home with just one line: 'export PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"'. Afterwards restart your terminal.

##### Windows
You can download Git from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com). You can hit "next" on all steps except for one; in the fifth step entitled "Adjusting your PATH environment", choose "Use Git and optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt" (the bottom option). Other than that, the defaults are fine. Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings is good.

Do not forget to restart the command prompt or powershell after the installation finished successfully.

##### Debian or Ubuntu

command-line

```
$ sudo apt-get install git
```
#### Get Yourself a GitHub Account
Go to [GitHub.com](https://GitHub.com) and sign up for a new, free user account.

That was the installation part. Congrats! \o/

### Reading the Introduction
The last thing we ask you to do before the workshop is to read the chapter ['How the Internet Works'](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/how_the_internet_works/) of the Django Girls tutorial.

Done? Great, now you are ready to go and we look forward to show you all about programming in the workshop. See you there! :)
