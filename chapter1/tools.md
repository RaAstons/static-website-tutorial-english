## Tools

We will start building a static website. To do this we will learn HTML and CSS. In addition to this, we will use some programming tools: Atom (your code editor), a code editor, Git, GitHub and we'll use the command line that we learnt about earlier.

### Code Editor
You have installed Atom in the [preparation chapter](/chapter1/preparation.md). This will be your code editor for this weekend and you'll open, change, save all your code files in it. Its kind of like Word but for your HTML, CSS (and later for your Python) files.

### Git [(link)](https://git-scm.com/)
Git is a version control system. You should already have it installed it while working through the [preparation chapter](/chapter1/preparation.md).
So what is Git userful for? Maybe you have already encountered the following problem. You are writing a report on something and while doing so you end up with a dozen files on your computer. They have names like report-v1, report-v2-corrected, report-final. It's the job of Git to avoid this kind of chaos happens with your code files. Git remembers which changes you made. Because of Git you don't have to rename your files all the time, while you can still go back to older versions at any time. On top of that each version has a description stored with it to help you remember what exactly you changed in this version.

### GitHub [(link)](https://github.com)
As the name already suggests GitHub has something to do with Git. It is a central location in the internet where you can store your codefiles with the help of git. The aim of GitHub is to make it possible for you to access your code files from everywhere. Also, it allows you to work together with other people on a programming project. It allows multiple people to change your files on GitHub. GitHub is very popular with software developers, as a lot of projects are to big to do on your own, and teams often are not at the same place but spread out over the world.

### Command Line

We got to know the command line toll already earlier today. Now we'll use it to operate Git in the command line.
