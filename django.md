Now it is time to combine all of the things you learned yesterday and create your own dynamic website with Django.

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is a Python web framework. Essentially, a web framework is a whole bunch of 
smaller programs that are put together so that they can be reused by other people. The Django web framework contains code written in Python that takes care of many things that you need for a website such as login/logout, saving the data somewhere and making sure that the links point to the correct place. You don't have to use a web framework to create a dynamic website, but it makes it a lot easier since you can just concentrate on the things that make your site different from all of the others. 

So go ahead and follow all of the Django chapters the official Django Girls Tutorial starting with the chapter ["What is Django?"](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/).
