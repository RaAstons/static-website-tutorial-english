# Django Girls Bern Extended Workshop

## What we will do during this workshop

### Learn how the internet works

this is explained very well in the Chapter [How the internet works](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/how_the_internet_works/) in the official Django Girls Tutorial. You can read this chapter at home as a preparation for the workshop.

### [Making a static websiteand publish it on Github](/chapter1.md)

### More programming with commandline and python

This is where things get nerdy \(but don't worry, your coach is there to help\). We let our static website rest for te time being and follow the Chapters[ Introduction to commandline](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/intro_to_command_line/) and [Introduction to python](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/python_introduction/) of the official Django Girls Tutorial. We will need both commandline and Python to overcome our next challenge: making a dynamic website.

### Django: Your Blog is a dynamic website

Now it is time to really get into the Django Girls tutorial. We start with the chapter [What is Django?](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/) Your Django Blog is a Project independent of your static Website, so you will have to start from a new folder. Also in Github we will store it separately from your previous code. Because Github can only serve static websites all by itself, we will have to publish \(also called deploy in programmer slang\) our website using yet another internet service called Pythonanywhere. So we will still use Github to store our code, but this time it is only an intermediate step, as we will still have to use another service to actually display our site.  This sounds complicated, and it is, when you have managed to get your dynamic site online, that really is a big achievement. But no worries, everything is explained in detail in the Django Girls Tutorial and we will help you to get there.

### Extras

Depending on your time and interest, you can work on those topics during the workshop, at home, or during one of the follow-up events:

* [Extras for your static website](/introduction.md)
* integrating your static website into your django project
* Using the [Django Girls Tutorial extensions](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/django/) to improve your blog.
